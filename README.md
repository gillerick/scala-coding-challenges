#### DSA Designs

#### 1. Array-Based Stack Implementation (Data Structures & Algorithms in Python, page 234)

- The implementations for _top_, _is_empty_, and _len_ use constant time in the worst case. The O(1) time for push and
  pop are **amortized** bounds a typical call to either of these methods uses constant time, but there is occasionally
  an O(n)-time worst case, where n is the current number of elements in the stack, when an operation causes the list to
  resize its internal array.

#### 2. Reversing Data Using a Stack (Data Structures & Algorithms in Python, page 235)

- One technical detail worth noting is that we intentionally strip trailing newlines from lines as they are read, and
  then re-insert newlines after each line when writing the resulting file. The reason for doing this is to handle a
  special case in which the original file does not have a trailing newline for the final line.
- If we exactly echoed the lines read from the file in reverse order, then the original last line would be followed
  (without newline) by the original second-to-last line. In our implementation, we ensure that there will be a
  separating newline in the result.

#### 3. Array-Based Queue Implementation (Data Structures & Algorithms in Python, page 241 - 246)

| Operation    | Running Time |
|--------------|:-------------:
| Q.enqueue(e) | O(1)*        |
| Q.dequeue()  | O(1)*        |
| Q.first()    | O(1)         |     
| Q.is_empty() | O(1)         |
| len(Q)       | O(1)         | 

*amortized

#### 4. Validating a Binary Sort Tree(BST)

- Even though there is no memory used the space complexity of this operation is O(d) where d is the depth of the tree
- The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we are traversing through each
  of the tree's nodes
- For a valid BST, a node's value has to be greater than or equal to the minimum value and less than the maximum value.

  ```python
  if tree.data < minValue or tree.data >= maxValue:
    return False
  ```

#### 5. Linked Lists

- A linked list is a data structure that represents a sequence of **nodes**. In a _singly linked list_, each node points
  to the next node in the linked list. In a _doubly linked list_, each node points to both the next node and the
  previous node in the linked list.
- In a linked list, the least significant digit always comes first. So that 2 -> 4 -> 7 -> 1 represents the
  number `1742`

##### 5.1. Creating a linked list

```java
class Node {
  Node next = null;
  int data;

  public Node(int d) {
    data = d;
  }

  void appendToTail(int d) {
    Node end = new Node(d);
    Node n = this;
    while (n.next != null) {
      n = n.next;
    }
    n.next = end;
  }
}
```

##### 5.2. Deleting a node from a singly linked list

- Given a node n, we first find the previous node `prev` and set `prev.next` equal to `n.next`. If the list is doubly
  linked, we must also update `n.next` to set `n.next.prev` to `n.prev`.
- The important thing to remember is (1) To check for the null pointer and (2) To update the head or tail pointer as
  necessary
- If this is implemented in a language that requires the developer to do memory management, deallocating the removed
  node should be considered.

```java
Node deleteNode(Node head, int d) {

    Node n = head;

    if (n.data == d) {
      return head.next; /*moved head*/
    }

    while (n.next != null) {
      if (n.next.data == d) {
        n.next = n.next.next;
        return head; /*head did not change*/
      }
      n = n.next;
    }
    return head;
  }
```
